# pyDFXM: A Python simulator for dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM)

This is a Python simulator for dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). It is based on the MATLAB implementation of the formulation in the [Poulsen et al. (2021) paper](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S1600576721007287).

## Installation

The simulator requires the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

## Example cases

The following example cases are provided:

- `test_resolution.py`: Test the resolution function of the simulator.
- `test_edge_disl.py`: Simulate the DFXM image of a single straight edge dislocation.
